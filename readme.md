## Project Title and Description

**Smartsense: Smart HVAC Monitoring Platform**

Smartsne is an innovative solution developed in collaboration with Belimo that transforms how building managers monitor, analyze, and optimize HVAC systems. By leveraging data from over 9 years.

## Our Product

### Problem Statement

Buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption, with HVAC systems being the primary contributor. Most building managers lack proper tools to monitor their HVAC systems efficiently. We know that data harvested over 10 years can be used. Our AI, data-driven solution empowers users to optimize their devices.

### Solution Overview

Our solutions integrates AI to learn the data and reduce waist.
